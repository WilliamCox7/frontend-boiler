### Properties Of Molecules

* Molecules are components that contain and organize "atoms".
  * Atoms are the most basic parts of a component like colors, typeography, and icons.
* Molecules have minimal functionality and should never have any specific business applications. It is a building block and nothing more.
* An example of a molecule would be a button. It has text and maybe an icon with some padding, color, and animations. It has an onClick handler but the onClick handler is a passed prop and not the molecule's own method.
